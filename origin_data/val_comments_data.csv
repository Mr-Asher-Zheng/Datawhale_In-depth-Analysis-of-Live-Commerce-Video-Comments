"There is no such thing like a Junk Lawsuit. This one has three reasons. At least. First: To scare Coffeezilla and make him renounce his claims. Second: To scare others away from reporting about a possible scam when they don't have the financial resources to stand through a lawsuit. Third: To look good for people who invest or have invested into the...project. People, especially fans of an influencer, tend to believe their ""hero"".

All that money - around $100M worth of ETH (at the time, more now) was supposed to pay for development, but how much was actually paid out to the developers - who claim they were underpaid - and how much was pocketed by different individuals associated with the project?

Foot pound used to be used as a unit of energy (and still is for air rifles etc), it was the work done lifting a pound by a foot against gravity I think we use Joules for energy here now. Torque is the product of force and distance from the axis of rotation, so inch pounds and foot pounds are used on torque wrenches ovee here still, but so are newton-metres, which are less ambiguous- I guess in the US where you don't have the luxury of SI units in general life, the pound- foot removes the ambiguity instead. man shrugging","(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"
