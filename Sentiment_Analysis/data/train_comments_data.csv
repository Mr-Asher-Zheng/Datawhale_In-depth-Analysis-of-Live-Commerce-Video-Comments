"Coffee will probably lose, if there's anything I've learnt it's that whoever is doing the legal work for Logan they are actually legitimately good. Logan never owned Crypto Zoo it was a partnership, just like he doesn't own Prime, he's a partner. Logan did the same thing he did for Crypto Zoo that he did with Prime, promoted it, and as a partner he would get a bit of the reward. Logan did specifically say who owned it, and that he also got rugged on the project, but the mob being the mob focuses on the person they recognise which was Logan. Coffee though, given he was ""investigating"" should have known better than to state that Logan scammed people, when he knew exactly who scammed people, but their names wouldn't bring views.","(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"

터키 리라화가 하락을 계속하고 있고 리라화가 엄청난 약세를 보이면 수입하는 물가는 그만큼 올라가고 인플레이션이 심해지죠. 인플레이션이 심화되는데 경제가 나쁘면 스테그 플레이션이 되는데 실질 임금은 줄고 물가는 오르면서 2중의 고통을 당하는거죠. 근데 더 문제는 터키의 경제가 살아날 기미를 보이지 않으니 실제로 터키사람들의 생활수준은 계속해서 하락할 수 밖에 없는거죠. 터키의 기준금리는 50%입니다. 터키는 2023년 5월 25일날 8%였는데 꾸준히 기준금리를 올려서 리라화를 방어할려고 계속 금리를 올려 50%까지 올렸지만 방어가 안 되는 불능의 상태가 되었습니다. 금리가 오르면 통화가 보통을 강세가 되는데 리라화는 금리를 엄청나게 올려도 환율이 방어가 안되면서 물가는 오르고 금리가 높으니 경제가 엄청나게 침체를 맞는거죠. 금리가 높으면 은행대출이자는 더 높고 대출을 받아 사업을 운영할 자금을 빌리 수도 없고 기업들이 수익이 나도 은행 이자도 못 값는 일이 발생하면서 파산이 생기고 실업자가 늘면서 거의 경제가 엉망진창이 되어버리죠.문제는 터키은행이자가 아무리 높아도 환율이 방어가 안되면 터키의 높은 이자를 받아서 잠시 행복하겠지만 터키 리라화가 계속 떨어지면 환차손이 발생해 받은 이자 이상으로 손실이 날 수도 있다는겁니다. 환율이 방어가 안되면 결국 미래는 암흑이며 베네수엘라처럼 하이퍼 인플레이션이 될 수도 있다는 겁니다.,"(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"

"Question for the LegalByte: This going to seem to come waaaaaaay out of left field but bear with me. So, way back in the dinosaur age when ""W"" Bush was in the White House, there was a bit of a problem for the pres at the time. Namely, a reporter by the name of Dan Rather had incriminating evidence on the president that happened during his time in the military. However, upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the evidence Rather had was fake because the typed copy he had that was supposedly from the 60s or 70s did not match the type of typewriters of that day & age. (yeah, it's that convoluted) It has been suggested that Rather knew this beforehand but ran with the story anyway. So my question is: Would this be considered Actual Malice had ""W"" sued Rather for defamation? My reasoning for asking the question: If the above would not be considered Actual Malice, then it would appear that Logan Paul has no chance in convincing a court that Coffeezilla's actions were Actual Malice. I mean, I like Dan Rather but that whole deal looked like a smear campaign to bring down another president to add to his collection.","(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"

"The issue is that the definition of scam is not representative of the project when we are specifically talking about Logan. Scam involves as a requirement having a gain of some sort. It can not be a scam if you didn't end up having any gain from said project. And we all know (even Coffeezilla acknowledged) that Logan himself has not sold any of his zoo tokens and as such has not made any income from the project. At all. Like literally 0. In fact, he most likely lost money for this project. So despite both sentences: ""Logan is the creator and frontman of the Cryptozoo project"" AND ""Cryptozoo is a scam"" are factually correct and indisputable. It still is not correct to say that Logan scammed people with Cryptozoo. Because that implies it was Logan to actually scam people, which is also factually wrong when we previously established the two concepts above.","(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"

I'm no lawyer but my understanding of defamation is that it requires malicious intent and proven losses. The thing of it is that in the social media world being defamed is actually profitable. Logan's numbers probably went up after Coffeezilla published his video. If anything he profited. Drama is worth money in this business to the point that it is often manufactured. This doesn't address Logan's other revenue sources but have a feeling that him proving this affair hurt him financially is going to be quite difficult. Odds are he made money off the scandal.

"So Coffee has just posted a couple of interesting new videos (and let's not forget Devin ""Legal Eagle"" Stone's video about this, either, where he talked with one of Coffee's lawyers). Key points: The timing of this lawsuit is very suspicious -- just 3 hours before a video about another questionable Logan Paul endeavor was about to drop. Coffee's insurance, which he thought he bought for exactly this situation, refuses to pay because, unknown to him or his broker, they explicitly excluded ""defamation"" lawsuits. And as a result, he's selling shirts to help cover his legal costs. I'll note that, as alluded to here, it's curious that this is filed as a federal suit, since both Paul and Findeisen apparently live in Texas. If true, that suggests that one of the first moves might be to get the suit moved into state court, where the SLAPP statute could be applied (thus avoiding the expensive discovery process -- though I agree that the results, on Paul's side, could prove very interesting).","(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"

"Something I imagine will be unearthed in discovery is the history and current state of the game (if it exists) and whether it advanced at all after Logan promised to finish it. The question ""what has Logan done to fulfill that promise?"" could be important, since if the answer is ""nothing"" it's going to be pretty hard to argue Coffee's statements were false. It would also settle the question of whether calling it ""Logan's scam"" is reasonable, as even if it wasn't exclusively his before, it became his after he promised to finish the project. IF he made no effort to follow through on that promise, I'm not sure what else you would call it but a scam. I AM sure Logan wishes they were both in the UK or Australia. Defamation laws there are brutally rigged in favour of wealthy plaintiffs. As it stands, I think he's going to get slapped with the Streisand Effect while pursuing this case. Reporting on the minutiae of YouTube celebrity drama, beef and misdeeds is a genre that whole channels are based on. The genre's narrative requires a ""villain"" to be ""exposed"", and it's almost never the little guy. Those channels will revisit every scandal Logan has ever been even adjacent to, and probably dig up some new ones as well. Maybe he's deliberately trying to build his reputation for villainy as part of his wrestling career.","(5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"
